  <h1>Extra Sounds Extension Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This extension does not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect any personal information</li>
    <li>Track user behavior</li>
    <li>Store or transmit data to external servers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All user preferences (sound URLs, settings) are stored locally using chrome.storage.sync. Audio files are loaded directly from user-provided URLs and never stored, but can be locally cached if that option is enabled in options. Through settings user is also able to clear cache.</p>
<p><strong>Local Files:</strong> Users may optionally provide file paths (e.g., <code>file:///</code>) to play local audio. 
These files are read once for playback and never stored or transmitted.</p>
