# Extra sounds
extrension for chromium-based browsers, lets you set custom sounds for:
- tab opened
- tab closed
- tab switched
<br><br>

you can set sounds from either url or file and also change volume level for each sound (0% - 200%)
<br><br>

# Installation
for now you cant install that extension from chrome web store, you would have to <a href="https://youtu.be/yNFwFQrc27Q?t=189">do that manually</a>
