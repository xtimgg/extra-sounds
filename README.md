# Extra sounds
extension for chromium-based browsers, lets you set custom sounds for:
- tab opened
- tab closed
- tab switched
- mouse (up, down)
- key pressed
- copy
- paste
- submit  

you can set sounds from either preset, file or url and also change volume level and pitch for each sound
there are currently 3 presets available and you can use any of them individually for any action (some of the sounds are designed by [zapocan](https://www.youtube.com/@zapocan))


# Possible features in future updates:
- even more sound actions
- separate sound speed and sound pitch sliders + random pitch shift option

# Installation
you can install that extension from [chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ibmbabeddalpanmbopnjlgcgcmdfboco)
